# Free AI Dataset Filtering Tool

> The hosted version, for your convenience, is [located here](https://free-ai-dataset-tool.forefront.ai/).

This tool allows you to quickly view your LLM fine tuning dataset, rate items, use any AI provider to generate similar examples to any example, or modify examples in some arbitrary way.

It has hotkeys for almost everything, so you can do all of this mouse-free, further speeding up the curation and augmentation of your data.

To use AI models for editing or generating new samples, you provide your own API key. Everything is client side, so we nor anyone else sees your API key. Feel free to dive into the code to see how everything works.

If you have any feedback or feature requests, we'd love to hear them! You can send us an email to support at forefront.ai
